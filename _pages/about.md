I am a first-year PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, where I am advised by Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html). I am interested in understanding human behavior and communication using large-scale data-driven methods from computational social science and natural language processing. 

My special interest is in anti-social behaviors like [cyberbullying](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7345) and [hate speech](http://claws.cc.gatech.edu/covid), and I am actively working to make the internet a safer place.

I am also working on understanding bias and political orientation in text. 

Moving forward, I hope to study misinformation and deception, coordinated market manipulations, as well as agenda-setting and linguistic framing, political movements, group-level conflicts, social roles, and patterns of abuse on the web.
