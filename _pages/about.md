I am a PhD student in the [**NLP Group**](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University <img src="assets/img/stanford.png" alt="stanford" height="20px"/>, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [**Diyi Yang**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html). 

My work spans empirical Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, and I'm particularly excited about three research thrusts: (1) dialect robust NLP [[**Multi-VALUE** (ACL 2023a)](http://value-nlp.org/); [**TADA** (ACL 2023b)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16651)\], (2) social NLP [[**NormBank** (ACL 2023c)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17008); [**MIC** (ACL 2022b)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03021); [**Positive Reframing** (ACL 2022c)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02952)\], and (3) safety in online communities [[**Racism is a Virus** (ASONAM 2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12423.pdf); [**Latent Hate** (EMNLP 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05322)\].

Previously, I finished my M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech <img src="assets/img/gt.png" alt="gt" height="20px"/> and my B.S. with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics from [**Emory University**](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) <img src="assets/img/emory.png" alt="emory" height="20px"/>. I was fortunate to spend some of my summers interning at [**Meta AI Applied Research**](https://ai.facebook.com/research/#notable-papers) <img src="assets/img/meta.png" alt="meta" height="12px"/> and [**USC ISI**](https://www.isi.edu/) <img src="assets/img/usc.png" alt="usc" height="20px"/>.

As of 2021, I am supported by the [**NSF GRFP**](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I'd love to hear from you! Please reach out :handshake:
