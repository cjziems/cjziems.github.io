Gave a (virtual) talk on our **[LLMs for CSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03514)** work at the **[Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS)](https://sicss.io/2023/roma-tor-vergata/people)** in Rome. Thanks for hosting me, **[Laura](https://eller.arizona.edu/people/laura-brandimarte)**!
