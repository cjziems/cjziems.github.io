I am a second-year PhD student in the [**School of Interactive Computing**](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [**Diyi Yang**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html). I study the social implications of language on the web, including [**political framing**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05325.pdf), [**hate speech**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05322.pdf), [**cyberbullying**](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7345). My research largely draws on methods from Computational Social Science and Natural Language Processing, and I actively collaborate with colleagues from Political Science, Public Policy, and Linguistics.

Previously, I spent my summers interning at [**Facebook AI Applied Research**](https://ai.facebook.com/research/#notable-papers), [**USC ISI**](https://www.isi.edu/), and [**Stanford CSLI**](https://www-csli.stanford.edu/). I received my B.S. with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics from [**Emory University**](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

As of 2021, I am supported by the [**NSF GRFP**](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I'd love to hear from you! Please reach out :grinning:
