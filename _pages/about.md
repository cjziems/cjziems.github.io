I am a first-year PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html). I study the social implications of language on the web, including political orientation of text, framing effects, and anti-social behaviors like [cyberbullying](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7345) and [hate speech](http://claws.cc.gatech.edu/covid). I am also interested in the ethical behavior of language models trained on web-scale language data. My research largely draws on methods from Computational Social Science and Natural Language Processing, and I actively collaborate with colleagues from Political Science, Public Policy, and Linguistics.
