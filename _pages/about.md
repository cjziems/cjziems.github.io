I am a PhD student in the [**NLP Group**](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University <img src="assets/img/stanford.png" alt="stanford" height="20px"/>, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [**Diyi Yang**](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/index.html). 

I find my research home in the Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. I'm excited about building more socially intelligent language technologies and applying them to both the science and reality of social life. In particular I've worked on: (1) social NLP [[**PAIR** (ACL 2024)](https://calebziems.com/); [**NormBank** (ACL 2023a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17008); [**Positive Reframing** (ACL 2022b)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02952)\], (2) variation-robust NLP [[**Multi-VALUE** (ACL 2023b)](http://value-nlp.org/); [**TADA** (ACL 2023c)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16651)\], and (3) CSS [[**LLMs for CSS** (CL 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03514); \] [**Framing Police Violence** (EMNLP 2021 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05325)\].

Previously, I finished my M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech <img src="assets/img/gt.png" alt="gt" height="20px"/> and my B.S. with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics from [**Emory University**](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) <img src="assets/img/emory.png" alt="emory" height="20px"/>. I was fortunate to spend some of my summers interning at [**Meta AI Applied Research**](https://ai.facebook.com/research/#notable-papers) <img src="assets/img/meta.png" alt="meta" height="12px"/> and [**USC ISI**](https://www.isi.edu/) <img src="assets/img/usc.png" alt="usc" height="20px"/>.

I am generously supported by the [**NSF GRFP**](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I'd love to hear from you! Please reach out :handshake:
